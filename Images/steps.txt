imageGallery.jsx is  a reuseable image component that is used as img zoom in out and other feature
we have to just simply import this component and pass necessary values.

but we have to crate modal first

we have to write this class in the root css file of our project
/* This is for preventing Default scrollbar when the imageGallery is loaded */
.prevent-scroll {
  overflow: hidden; /* Completely prevent scrolling */
  touch-action: none; /* Prevent touch gestures like scrolling and zooming */
}
/* This is for preventing Default scrollbar when the imageGallery is loaded  End*/
